            <b>Maria Salomea Skłodowska-Curie</b>, known simply as
            <b>Marie Curie</b> is remembered for her discovery of radium and
            polonium, and her huge contribution to finding treatments for
            cancer. This work continues to inspire our charity's mission to
            drive fundamental change in end of life care so that everyone can
            have the best possible quality of life to the end. In 1903 Marie and
            Pierre were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics jointly with Henri
            Becquerel for their combined, though separate, work on
            radioactivity. In the same year, Marie passed her doctorate thesis
            in Physics. Her determination and remarkable endeavours led to a
            second Nobel Prize in 1911, this time in chemistry for creating a
            means of measuring radioactivity. Not long after, Sorbonne built the
            first radium institute with two laboratories; one for study of
            radioactivity under Marie Curie's direction, and the other for
            biological research into the treatment of cancer. Marie Curie During
            the First World War, Marie Curie worked to develop small, mobile
            X-ray units that could be used to diagnose injuries near the
            battlefront. As Director of the Red Cross Radiological Service, she
            toured Paris, asking for money, supplies and vehicles which could be
            converted. In October 1914, the first machines, known as "Petits
            Curies", were ready, and Marie set off to the front. She worked with
            her daughter Irene, then aged 17, at casualty clearing stations
            close to the front line, X-raying wounded men to locate fractures,
            bullets and shrapnel. The technology Marie Curie developed for the
            "Petits Curies" is similar to that used today in the fluoroscopy
            machine at our Hampstead hospice. A powerful X-ray machine, it
            allows doctors to examine moving images in the body, such as pumping
            action of the heart or the motion of swallowing. After the war,
            Marie continued her work as a researcher, teacher and head of a
            laboratory and received many awards and prizes. Among them were the
            Ellan Richards Research Prize (1921), the Grand Prix du Marquis
            d'Argenteuil (1923) and the Cameron Prize from Edinburgh University
            (1931). She was also the recipient of many honorary degrees from
            universities around the world.
